## Employee Attrition Analysis and Dashboard

This project addresses the challenge of employee attrition by providing a real-time, dynamic dashboard for HR to track key metrics and gain insights into employee departures.  The goal was to empower HR to be more independent in accessing and analyzing employee data, reducing reliance on data analysts and manual data entry.

**Situation:**

The HR department faced increasing employee attrition and needed a better understanding of the factors contributing to these departures.  They required insights into the gender and age distribution of employees, the primary reasons for leaving, and key performance indicators (KPIs) like active employee count, average employee age, attrition rate, attrition tenure, and job satisfaction.  The existing process involved manual data entry and frequent requests to the data analyst team, making it slow and inefficient.

**Task:**

My task was to develop a solution that would enable HR to independently access and analyze employee data in real-time.  This involved creating a dynamic dashboard that automatically updates with the latest information, eliminating manual data entry and reducing the need for data analyst intervention.  The dashboard needed to visualize key metrics such as gender distribution, age range, reasons for attrition, active employee count, average employee age, attrition rate, attrition tenure, and job satisfaction.

**Action:**

I implemented a forum-based Excel dataset using KoboToolbox for data collection. This allowed for real-time updates to the Excel sheet, which served as the data source for the dynamic dashboard.  HR could directly input employee data, including reasons for leaving, into the KoboToolbox form, and the Excel sheet (and therefore the dashboard) would update automatically. This eliminated the need for manual data entry and ensured data accuracy.  The dashboard itself was designed to visualize the required KPIs and provide clear insights into attrition trends.

**Results:**

The analysis revealed that the primary drivers of attrition were "Better Opportunities," followed by "Job Dissatisfaction" and "Personal Reasons."  Based on these findings, I recommended the following actions:

*   **Targeted Recruitment:**  Prioritize the recruitment of young and dynamic candidates, particularly through internship programs, to address the "Better Opportunities" factor.
*   **Job Role Focus:**  Increase recruitment efforts for marketing and sales job roles, as these areas may be experiencing higher attrition rates.  Further investigation may be needed to understand why these roles have higher attrition.
*   **Further Analysis:**  Investigate the "Job Dissatisfaction" reason further to identify specific areas for improvement in employee engagement and satisfaction. This could involve conducting employee surveys or exit interviews.

The dynamic dashboard now provides HR with a real-time view of key employee metrics, enabling them to proactively address attrition issues and make data-driven decisions regarding recruitment and employee retention strategies.  This solution significantly reduces HR's reliance on data analysts and empowers them to manage employee data more effectively.
