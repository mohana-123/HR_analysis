## Employee Attrition Analysis

**Situation:**

*   **Problem:** Increasing employee attrition impacting business continuity and requiring data-driven solutions.
*   **Need:** HR lacked a streamlined process for understanding attrition drivers and key employee metrics.  Current manual data entry and reliance on data analysts were inefficient.
*   **Statistic:** Attrition rate in the last quarter was 15%, a 5% increase from the previous quarter.  Average time to fill open positions was 30 days.

**Task:**

*   **Objective:** Develop a self-service solution for HR to access and analyze employee data in real-time, reducing manual effort and reliance on data analysts.
*   **Deliverables:** A dynamic dashboard visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee demographics, attrition, and satisfaction.
*   **Statistic:** Target reduction in manual data entry time by 75%.

*   **Technology:** Utilized KoboToolbox for data collection and Excel for data storage and dashboard creation.
*   **Statistic:**  KoboToolbox form deployed and tested with 10 HR users. Dashboard refresh rate set to every hour.
